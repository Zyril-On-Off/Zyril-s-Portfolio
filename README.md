### About Section
**Title**: "About Me"

**Content**:
I'm a developer who bridges the gap between programming and gaming. My journey started with a simple question: "How can I enhance my gaming experience through code?" This led me to create custom HUDs for Dota 2 using AutoHotkey, develop scripts for Roblox, and build mods for Minecraft.

**What I Do**:
- Full-stack web development
- Python automation and scripting
- .NET application development
- Video and photo editing
- Game modifications and scripting

**Beyond Code**:
When I'm not programming, you'll find me on the basketball court, volleyball net, or badminton court. I'm also passionate about dancing, singing, and playing instruments. I believe in exploring diverse interests - it keeps creativity flowing and prevents burnout.

**Philosophy**: "I love exploring new things. That's why I have so many interests - I don't get bored often."
